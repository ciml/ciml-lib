Readme
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This branch contains a Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) implementation to design 
  Combinational Logic Circuits (CLC's). This source code was used at the submitted 
  paper named "A Benchmark Suite for Designing Combinational Logic Circuits via 
  Metaheuristics", and made available in order to increase the reproducibility.

Structure of files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - bin: This folder contains the binary file compiled from the source code and use to 
    run the program.

  - include: This folder contains the "cgp.h" file wich implements the 
    Cartesian Genetic Programming representation used to solve the problems from the 
    proposed benchmark.

  - tables: This folder contains all the problems used at the benchmark. 
    Those files are structured as following:
      1) .p represents the number of lines into the problem's truth table.
      2) .i represents the number of inputs from the problem.
      3) .o represents the number of outputs from the problem.
      4) After those basic informations about the problem and its truth table, we'ill find at 
      each line the boolean expression for each output. The boolean expressions presented
      at the files were obtained from the LGSynth'91 benchmarks, 
      available at: https://ddd.fit.cvut.cz/prj/Benchmarks/.
    Its important to notice that each file describes the problem that we're optimizing, 
    and therefore used as an input to the source code.

  - results: This folder contains all the results obtained from the two set of experiments 
  proposed on the paper, with indepent runs for each problem and each of the CGP 
  variants proposed. The results from the 1st experiment set are present at the folder 
  named 1st-experiment-set separated in two folders, each one from an mutation used. 
  The results from the 2nd experiment set are present as the first one, but in the 
  folder named 2nd-experiment-set.
    Each file on results folder are structured as follows:
      1) The mutation algorithm used (SAM, SAM+GAM or PM).
      2) .p represents the number of lines into the problem's truth table.
      3) .i represents the number of inputs from the problem.
      4) .o represents the number of outputs from the problem.
      5) After those basic informations about the problem and its truth table, we'ill find at 
        each line the boolean expression for each output.
      6) After the first set of hiphens we have informations about the process of findig a 
        feasible circuit. SAT COUNT = 0 means that we've found the first feasible circuit.
      7) If a feasible circuit is found we print the number of gates (for each gate 
        and total), the total number of transistors and the circuit for each output.
      8) After those informations we start the minimization of the transistors numbers.
      9) When the maximun number of generations is reached we print the final circuit,
      informations (those informations are the same of the first feasible solution).
      10) As last information we have the time (in seconds) spent to run the program.

Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CGP is an method developed by Miller et al. in 1997 [1]. Its capable of enconding 
  different types of programs due to the two-dimensional grid of nodes representeds by 
  directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). 
  The most common application is to optimize Combinational Logic Circuits (CLCs).

  CGP is an evolutionary algorithm that uses (mu+lambda)-ES, with mu=1 and lambda=4 
  (tipycally), and point mutation with 5% rate of mutation as standard. Here we implent 
  more features in order to improve the computational cost of optimizing circuits. 
  We implemented 2 more kinds of mutations named as SAM and GAM, as well SAMGAM that 
  is a combination of this 2 mutations. SAMGAM reduce the number of evaluations needed 
  to find a feasible solution, as show in [2]. Besids that we adopt the Binary Decision 
  Diagram (BDD) to evaluate individiuals fitness, due to  the speedup reported in [3].

  There are two implemented options to optimize circuits:
    1- Start CGP's population randomly, evolve until a feasible solution and then
    minimize the number of transistors needed in the circuit.
    2- Start CGP's population with a factible solution and minimize the number of
    transistors needed in the circuit.
  Into the proposed paper we use both options in order that the benchmark users
  can compare any of this options to their algorithm, depending if they start with
  a factible solution or not.

How to run the program
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  To run the program we need to send some informations through terminal. There will be
  different informations depending if the initital population is randomly seeded or not.
  We'ill start with random population. The informations should obey the order that they
  are presented bellow.
  Random population:
  1) tables              - the circuit being optimized.
  2) seed                - the seed used in the execution. 
  3) ncol                - the number of columns of the genotype.
  4) maxgen              - the maximun number of generations to optimize the circuit.
  5) mutation            - the mutation algorithm being used.
  6) file (optional)     - the file path to store the program results.

  Population sow with factible solution:
  1) tables              - the circuit being optimized.
  2) seed                - the seed used in the execution. 
  3) ncol                - the number of columns of the genotype.
  4) maxgen              - the maximun number of generations to optimize the circuit.
  5) mutation            - the mutation algorithm being used.
  6) ngates              - the number of gates needed in the initital circuit (i.e.
  the number of OR & AND gates plus the number of inputs from the circuit).
  7) mediangen           - the number of generation to print the circuit informations
  8) file (optional)     - the file path to store the program results.
